ðŸŽ¬ðŸ“ˆ If you're interested in the world of film production and data analysis, this project is a great example of how data can inform decision-making in the industry. 
I worked with RSVP Movies, an Indian production company, to analyze data on past movie releases and provide insights for their upcoming global release in 2022. Through my analysis, I was able to provide recommendations that could help them make informed decisions and achieve success with their new project. This project showcases my skills in data analysis and my ability to provide valuable insights to inform business strategies.
